## I share my UI/UX Design Experience üôå

Hi. I am KyungHwan Kim, UI/UX Designer based in South Korea. 'SHARE DESIGN' is a space to share my UI/UX Design Experience with people around the world.

I'm learning and inspiring by a lot thanks to the experience shared by designers around the world. As a UI/UX Designer, I also wanted to share my experience around the world.

SHARE DESIGN is the result. I plan to continue to share my UI/UX Design Experience through SHARE DESIGN.
