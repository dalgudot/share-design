## I share my UI/UX Design Experiences

Hi. My name is KyungHwan Kim. I am a UI/UX Designer based in South Korea. I am inspired and learning a lot thanks to the experiences shared by so many people around the world. As a UI/UX Designer, I also wanted to share my experiences and thoughts around the world. This portfolio website is the result. I plan to continue to update through this website and share my UI/UX Design Experiences.
