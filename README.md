## I share my UI/UX Design Experiences üôå

Hi. My name is KyungHwan Kim. I am a UI/UX Designer based in South Korea. This Portfolio Website is for sharing my UI/UX Design Experiences with people around the world.

I am inspired and learning a lot thanks to the experiences shared by so many people around the world. As a UI/UX Designer, I also wanted to share my experiences and thoughts around the world.

This portfolio website is the result. I plan to continue to share my UI/UX Design Experiences through this website.
